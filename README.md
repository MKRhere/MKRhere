### Hi, MKRhere!

I'm a 29 year old architect-turned-developer who specialises in TypeScript. I'm passionate about accessible and fast web services. I occasionally experiment with ⚡️ Zig!

I got into active development 7 years ago, with my joining [The Devs Network](https://github.com/thedevs-network). Since then, I've been an active open sourcer, working on many projects over the years. I've now focused my attention down to three main projects I maintain:

* [**Telegraf**](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf), the most popular Telegram bot API framework.
* [**Hyperactive**](https://github.com/feathers-studio/hyperactive), a lean approach to a reactive UI library and webserver library (Deno-first).
* [**Telecraft**](https://github.com/MadrasMC/Telecraft), a Minecraft server management tool that wraps the server and integrates with plugins to provide offline auth, bridge to messengers, etc.
