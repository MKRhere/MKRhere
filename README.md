### Hi, MKRhere!

Hello, I'm a 27 year old architect-turned-software-developer who specialises in TypeScript. I'm passionate about accessible and fast web services.

I got into active development 5 years ago, with my joining https://github.com/thedevs-network/. Since then, I've been an active open sourcer, working on many projects over the years. I've now focused down to three main projects I maintain:

* **Telegraf**, the most popular Telegram bot API framework.
* **Hyperactive**, a lean approach to a reactive UI library and webserver library (Deno-first).
* **Telecraft**, a Minecraft server management tool that wraps the server and integrates with plugins to provide offline auth, bridge to messengers, etc.
