### Hi, MKRhere!

I'm a 28 year old architect-turned-developer who specialises in TypeScript. I'm passionate about accessible and fast web services. Recently I've also begun experimenting with ⚡️ Zig!

I got into active development 6 years ago, with my joining [The Devs Network](https://github.com/thedevs-network). Since then, I've been an active open sourcer, working on many projects over the years. I've now focused my attention down to three main projects I maintain:

* **Telegraf**, the most popular Telegram bot API framework.
* **Hyperactive**, a lean approach to a reactive UI library and webserver library (Deno-first).
* **Telecraft**, a Minecraft server management tool that wraps the server and integrates with plugins to provide offline auth, bridge to messengers, etc.
